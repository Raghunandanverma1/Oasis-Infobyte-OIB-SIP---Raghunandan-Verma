     The project was all about cleaning and managing null values and then finding outliers and removing the outliers for a balanced dataset.

  <h4>Project 3 :  Wine Quality Prediction</h4>
     The project 3 is Wine Quality Prediction. The dataset is taken from Kaggle, and then managed and cleaned at Jupyter notebook(file - "Wine Quality Prediction.ipynb").
     The various steps involved in the Projects are Loading Dataset, Cleaning Dataset , Analysing the Dataset , Feature Selection , Feature Importance , Splitting Dataset and Selecting Models.
